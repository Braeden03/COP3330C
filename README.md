Write a Java program that accomplishes the following tasks.

Create a List - Declare an ArrayList of Strings. Using a loop, and allow the user to add eight pieces of data (just a single word) to the collection. Do not allow the user to enter duplicate entries, ignoring case. 
Print the List - Print the list to the screen, using an enhanced for loop.  Also print the total number of entries, the longest entry, and the shortest entry within the list.
Sort the List-  Using the method Collections.sort, sort the list and output it to the screen.  Include a header that indicates that the list is now been sorted.
Custom Sort the List - sort the list by the number of characters in each string entered, from longest name to shortest.  Include a header that indicates that the list is now been sorted by character length.
Shuffle the List - Using the shuffle method, shuffle the list and output it to the screen.  Include a header that indicates that the list is now been sorted. 
Search the List: Ask the user to provide a word to search for within the list.  If the data exists (ignoring case); output the location where it was found. If the data does not exist, display a message to the user indicating this.
Implement at least 2 other static methods from the Collections class:  Research the documentation for the Collections class and add at least 2 other static methods in your code.  You may pick which two methods to implement.  Print the results from each method call, and display a header that indicates what operation was just performed on the data.
Convert the List to an Array: Convert the list to an array using toArray. Output the elements of the array.
Convert the array back into a list. Output the elements of the list.  Include headers for both, indicating to the user what output they see.
Comment on Collections vs. Collection:  In a /* multi-line comment in your code, */ describe in your own words the difference between Collections and Collection, and more broadly, the difference between a class and an interface. Please be thorough yet succinct. Cite your sources.
